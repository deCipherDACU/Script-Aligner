# ScriptAligner - Adobe Premiere Pro UXP Plugin

ScriptAligner is an offline, privacy-focused tool for aligning raw SRT subtitles with a correct script. It is designed to run directly inside Adobe Premiere Pro as a UXP panel.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Adobe Premiere Pro** (v23.0 or higher)
2.  **Adobe UXP Developer Tools** (Download from Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop App)

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Build the Plugin:**
    Open a terminal in this directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `dist` folder containing the compiled plugin.

2.  **Load into UXP Developer Tools:**
    *   Open **Adobe UXP Developer Tools**.
    *   Click **Add Plugin**.
    *   Navigate to the `dist` folder in this project:
        `.../Render/scriptaligner (2)/dist`
    *   Select the folder. You should see "ScriptAligner" appear in the list.

3.  **Load into Premiere Pro:**
    *   Open **Adobe Premiere Pro**.
    *   In the UXP Developer Tools, find "ScriptAligner" in the list.
    *   Click the **Load** button (Play icon) or **Debug** button.
    *   The plugin panel should appear inside Premiere Pro.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Panel:**
    If not already open, go to `Window > Extensions > ScriptAligner` (Note: UXP panels sometimes appear under `Window > Extensions` or directly in the `Window` menu depending on the version, or simply pop up when loaded via UDT).

2.  **Load Source File:**
    *   Drag and drop your raw `.srt` file (generated by Premiere's Speech to Text or other tools) into the "Load Source File" area.

3.  **Paste Correct Script:**
    *   Paste your perfectly edited script into the text area.
    *   Alternatively, upload a text file containing the script.

4.  **Auto Correct:**
    *   Click **Auto Correct**.
    *   The tool will align the correct words from your script to the timestamps of the raw SRT.

5.  **Review & Export:**
    *   Review the changes in the "Diff" view or "Editor" view.
    *   Use "Find & Replace" if needed.
    *   Click **Download SRT** to save the corrected file.
    *   Import the new SRT back into Premiere Pro.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Panel doesn't load?** Check the UXP Developer Tools console for errors. Ensure `manifest.json` is in the `dist` folder.
*   **Styling looks wrong?** Ensure `index.css` is correctly built and linked (handled by Vite).
